| [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)                         | Yes            | Use python language so easier, can easily use qiskit | User needs a Python interpreter to use|
| [godot](https://godotengine.org/)                             | Yes            | Seems simpler                                        | Unsure if qiskit is officially supported |
| Unity: [qisge](https://github.com/qiskit-community/Qisge)     | Yes            | User doesn't need to install anything, code mostly in Python | Supports only very basic gaming features (e.g. using images, keyboard, sound) |
| Unity: [QCU](https://github.com/TigrisCallidus/QCU)           | Yes            | User doesn't need to install anything, supports advanced game features | Python is only used for qiskit so code will mostly be in C# |
