# Project proposal

## Requirements

Once all teams are formed, you’ll work with your team to write a project proposal. Project proposals are submitted by TEAMS.

What is a project proposal? A project proposal should include 3 slides describing: 

1. Project idea
2. Impact and goals
3. Implementation plan: Timeline, tasks & resources (research papers, Qiskit libraries/modules...) 

Note: All projects must be based on Qiskit. 

## Proposal Judging Criteria

When preparing your projects, it’s important to be familiar with the judging criteria as it applies to Phase 1 Proposals and Phase 2 Final Project Submission. Please note that it is a requirement for eligibility that all projects are based in Qiskit. 

These are 3 evaluation criteria for project proposals submitted at the end of Phase 1. Each criterion will be scored on a scale of 1-10, should the proposal fail to address the criterion or cannot be assessed due to missing or incomplete information, it will be given an automatic zero.

### Criterion 1 - Excellence
Weight: **40.00%**

Compared to what you’ve seen before, how original/unique is this proposal? 
How relevant is the research question and project?

### Criterion 2 - Impact
Weight: **30.00%**

How well does the proposal advance research and open source science in the field of quantum computing? 
How useful is this idea? Does it have prospects for future development? 
Will this project help the community at large? Will this project spark interest in the quantum computing community?

### Criterion 3 - Implementation
Weight: **30.00%**

How feasible and effective is the work plan within the timeframe considering the allocation of tasks and resources?
How coherent and structured is the proposal? 


## Slide content

### Slide 1 - Project Idea
- Which field of quantum computing is your proposal about? 
- Which is the topic of your proposal? 
- Which question/s do you want to address? 
- Provide a technical description of the proposal. 

Main idea: implementing a tetris game that teaches several quantum concepts while still being fun.
Which fields:
    - Quantum noise
    - Quantum simulator and noise models
    - Error mitigation
    - Education
Quantum tetris game where the tetriminos may be impacted by noise of the underlying quantum chip. The game will include several texts and links about quantum noise, the differences between a simulator and a real hardware, the possibilities of error mitigation, etc...


### Slide 2 - Impact and Goals
- What would you like to achieve with this proposal? 
- Which value does this proposal bring to the specific field of interest (QML/ quantum games...) and to the wider quantum computing field?
- How novel is your proposal?
- Which are the near-term and long-term goals for this proposal?


### Slide 3 - Implementation Plan: Timeline, Tasks, & Resources
- What are the phases/steps of your project? Build the timeline of your project based on the deadline for each phase.
- Which skills are required for each phase? Who in your team has these skills? How do you plan to divide the tasks within your team? 
- Which resources do you plan to use for developing your project? (Qiskit libraries/modules, game engines, research papers references, etc)
