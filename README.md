# Qutris

Main git repository for the qutris project, a Tetris game that uses quantum computing in random selection of tetrimino block and generation of noise in the blocks' shapes. 

## Focus of the project

The project should focus on two things:

#### 1. Having a nice game:
   1. Easily installable
   2. Nice looking
   3. Easy to navigate and fun
#### 2. Making the content educational 
   1. Quantum noise - Users will play stages with different difficulties, with different noise levels in the block selection circuit. The greater the noise, more random the shape of the blocks will be. With fake backends, users will be able to see the levels of different types of noise, and their impact on the game.
   2. Quantum simulator and noise models - Users will be able to choose which type of noise models, quantum simulators, or chips will be used for block selection/generation. By playing with them and reading explanations about them, users will then be able to compare and learn about them.  
   3. Error mitigation - This can be used as a power-up to reduce the level of noise in block generation.
